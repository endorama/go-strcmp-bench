I read this article https://go101.org/blog/2022-10-01-three-way-string-comparison.html

It states that `strings.Compare` in Golang is not optimzed, so it run slow.

It suggest to implement something like `bytes.Compare`, that relies on machine implementation and is thus more performant.

The article proposal is to "optimize `strings.Compare`". The Golang solution is to **never use** `strings.Compare` and leverage built-in operators instead (`==`, `<`, `>`).

I was curios so I decided to write some benchmark to understand what's the difference.

I implemented 4 test cases: 
1. string comparison using built-in operators
2. string comparison using `strings.Compare`
3. bytes comparison using `bytes.Compare` with string to bytes conversion just for the comparison
4. bytes comparison using `bytes.Compare` with byte sequences

The results? Here:
